See https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/beginners/how-to-use-latex/
 for a brief intro.


Run 
./compile.sh 
to compile the tex file in tex/ directory.

If there are warnings, you may need to 
run 
./compile.sh
 once more to get rid of them.

Figures are taken from the figs/ directory.


A .pdf file will be produced after you
